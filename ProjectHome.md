# What is Nurpawiki? #
Nurpawiki is a personal information manager (PIM) application that combines a wiki, a to-do list and a simple scheduler to help you get organized.  It aims to ease note taking and action planning.  Actions (to-dos) are always associated with notes or plans (wiki pages).

Read about [its history](History.md).

Nurpawiki currently being extended to support multiple users in order to help organize small team development.

# Development #
The application is written in [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr) and uses the fantastic [Ocsigen web programming framework](http://www.ocsigen.org/).  It runs in a web server and uses SQL for persistence.  It can thus be hosted on Linux and used on on Windows or any other web browser capable platform.
